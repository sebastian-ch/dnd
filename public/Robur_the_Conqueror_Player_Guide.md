## Who Is Robur?

Robur is a **Duergar Tyrant** (evil psychic dwarf from the Underdark) and a level 1 **Antipaladin** (the evil mirror of a paladin). He's a cunning manipulator with powerful telekinetic abilities who serves dark powers.

**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil — You're a villain. Embrace deception, cruelty, and self-interest (while still being a team player at the table!).

## Your Combat Round — What To Do

### Before Combat
1. **Detect Good** (at will, move action to focus) — Identify who's good-aligned so you know who to Smite
2. **Consider Telekinetic Invisibility** — Go invisible for a surprise attack

### Standard Combat Turn

**Option A: Melee Attack**
- Roll d20 + 5 to hit
- Deal 1d6 + 4 damage on a hit

**Option B: Smite Good** (1/day, swift action + attack)
- Declare Smite Good as a **swift action** against a good creature
- Then attack normally
- You gain: +1 damage (+2 if target is a good outsider, dragon, cleric, or paladin)
- Note: Your Charisma is low, so you get no attack bonus from Smite — just damage

**Option C: Mind Thrust I** (psychic magic)
- Costs **1 PE** (you have 5/day)
- Deals **1d6 damage** to one creature within range
- Will save DC 12 for half damage
- **Great for:** Hitting enemies you can't reach, or finishing off wounded foes

### Turn Structure Reminder
| Action Type | What You Can Do |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Swift** | Smite Good, some telekinesis |
| **Move** | Move 20 ft, OR focus Detect Good, OR Basic Telekinesis |
| **Standard** | Attack, OR cast psychic magic |
| **Full-Round** | Telekinetic Haul (lift heavy objects) |

---

## Your Psychic Powers (5 PE per day)

You have a pool of **5 Psychic Energy (PE)** that refreshes daily. Spend it on:

| Ability | PE Cost | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Mind Thrust I** | 1 PE | 1d6 mental damage, Will DC 12 half, Medium range |
| **Ironskin** | 2 PE | Gain DR 4/adamantine for ~1 min/level |

**Ironskin** is excellent — cast it before a tough fight to reduce incoming damage!

---

## Your Telekinetic Abilities (At Will!)

These don't cost PE — use them freely:

| Ability | Action | What It Does |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Basic Telekinesis** | Move | Lift/move objects ≤5 lbs up to 15 ft |
| **Telekinetic Finesse** | Varies | Use Disable Device, Sleight of Hand, etc. from up to 30 ft away |
| **Telekinetic Haul** | Full-round | Lift objects up to 100 lbs, move 10 ft/round |
| **Telekinetic Invisibility** | Standard | Become invisible (ends if you attack) |
| **Kinetic Form** | — | Flight at level 6+ (not available yet) |

### Creative Uses
- **Telekinetic Finesse:** Pick locks from across the room, steal keys without touching anyone, trip enemies at range using your CMB
- **Telekinetic Invisibility:** Scout ahead, set up ambushes, escape danger
- **Basic Telekinesis:** Distract guards, trigger traps from safety, grab small objects

---

## Your Defenses

### Strengths
- **Spell Resistance 12** — Enemies casting spells on you must roll caster level + d20 ≥ 12 or the spell fails
- **Immune to:** Paralysis, Phantasms (a type of illusion), Poison
- **Good saves:** Fort +4, Will +4

### Weaknesses
⚠️ **Light Sensitivity:** You're **dazzled** (−1 attack, −1 Perception) in bright light (sunlight, *daylight* spell)

⚠️ **AC 10:** You have NO ARMOR! Buy armor immediately — even a chain shirt (AC +4) would help enormously.

⚠️ **Low Reflex (+0):** Dodge area effects carefully. Fireballs hurt.

⚠️ **Terrible Charisma (5):** Your Smite Good doesn't add an attack bonus, and social skills suffer. Lean on Bluff (+3) and Sense Motive (+6) where you can.

---

## Skills & Social Interaction

| Skill | Bonus | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **Sense Motive** | +6 | Detecting lies, reading people — your best skill! |
| **Bluff** | +3 | Lying, feinting in combat, creating distractions |
| **Intimidate** | +1 | Threatening people (not great due to low Cha) |

**Feat: Noble Impostor** — This helps you impersonate nobility or authority figures. Combined with your telekinetic abilities and Bluff, you can run elaborate cons.

**Languages:** Common, Dwarven, Undercommon, Abyssal, Aklo — You can communicate with underground creatures, demons, and aberrations.

---

## Leveling Up — What's Coming

As an Antipaladin, you'll gain:

| Level | Key Abilities |
|-------|---------------|
| 2 | **Touch of Corruption** (heal yourself or harm with a touch), **Unholy Resilience** (Cha to saves — won't help you much) |
| 3 | **Aura of Cowardice** (enemies in 10 ft take −4 vs fear), **Cruelty** (add conditions to Touch of Corruption), **Plague Bringer** (spread disease) |
| 4 | **Spells!** (1st-level antipaladin spells), **Channel Negative Energy** |
| 5 | **Fiendish Boon** (summon a fiend or enhance your weapon) |

Your Duergar Tyrant telekinesis also improves with character level.

## Shopping List (Priority Purchases)

1. **Armor!** (Chain shirt: 100 gp, +4 AC, or Scale mail: 50 gp, +5 AC)
2. **Shield** (Heavy steel: 20 gp, +2 AC — you can still use sword cane one-handed)
3. **Smoked Goggles** (10 gp) — Negates light sensitivity but gives −4 Perception
4. **Potions of Cure Light Wounds** (50 gp each) — Emergency healing

---

## Roleplaying Tips

Robur is a schemer from the dark depths who walks among surface-dwellers. Consider:

- **Superiority complex:** Duergar consider themselves the "true dwarves" — you likely look down on surface races
- **Pragmatic evil:** You serve dark powers, but you're not stupid about it
- **The Noble Impostor:** You can pass yourself off as nobility — what's your cover story?
- **Telekinetic tricks:** Use your powers for dramatic effect — objects floating, doors opening on their own, speaking without moving your lips

**Party dynamics:** You're CE, which can be tricky. Focus your villainy on NPCs and enemies, not your party. Think "Magnificent Bastard" rather than "Random Murder Hobo."

*Good luck conquering, Robur!*
