**ELKFOR WILDWOOD**

_A Beginner's Guide to Playing a Hobgoblin Necromancer_

# Welcome, New Adventurer

This guide will help you understand and play Elkfor Wildwood, a level 1 Hobgoblin Necromancer. Necromancers are wizards who specialize in magic dealing with death, undead, and life force. Don't worry if this sounds complicated-we'll break everything down step by step!

# Character at a Glance

| **Race** | Hobgoblin |
| --- | --- |
| **Class** | Wizard (Necromancer) 1 |
| **Hit Points** | 8   |
| **Armor Class** | 11 (touch 11, flat-footed 10) |
| **Initiative** | +3  |
| **Speed** | 30 feet |

# What is a Necromancer?

A Necromancer is a type of Wizard who specializes in the school of Necromancy-magic that manipulates life force, creates undead creatures, and instills fear. As a specialist wizard, you gain extra power with necromancy spells but have chosen to give up proficiency in two other schools (Conjuration and Divination), making those spells harder to cast.

**Your Role in the Party:** You're a "glass cannon"-powerful but fragile. With only 8 HP and light armor (AC 11), you should stay behind the fighters. Your job is to debuff enemies with fear, support allies, and eventually raise undead minions to fight for you.

# Understanding Your Ability Scores

Ability scores represent your character's raw capabilities. Each score provides a modifier that gets added to related rolls. Here's what yours mean:

| **Ability** | **Score** | **What It Means** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Strength** | 7 (-2) | Below average. Avoid melee combat and carrying heavy loads. |
| **Dexterity** | 12 (+1) | Slightly above average. Helps with AC and ranged attacks. |
| **Constitution** | 14 (+2) | Good! Gives you extra HP and helps resist poison/disease. |
| **Intelligence** | 18 (+4) | Excellent! Your spellcasting stat. More spells, higher DC. |
| **Wisdom** | 10 (+0) | Average. Affects Perception and Will saves. |
| **Charisma** | 10 (+0) | Average. Not important for your class. |

# Combat Basics

## Your Combat Numbers

- **Initiative +3:** When combat starts, roll a d20 and add 3. Higher goes first.
- **AC 11:** Enemies need to roll 11 or higher (plus their bonuses) to hit you. This is low-stay in the back!
- **HP 8:** You can take 8 points of damage before falling unconscious. Be very careful.
- **Saving Throws:** Fort +2, Ref +1, Will +2. These help you resist spells and effects.

## What You Can Do Each Turn

On your turn, you typically get: one standard action, one move action, and one swift action. Common options include:

- **Cast a Spell (Standard Action):** Your main contribution to combat. See the Spells section below.
- **Use Grave Touch (Standard Action):** Touch an enemy to make them shaken (frightened). Risky because you must be close!
- **Move (Move Action):** Move up to 30 feet. Use this to stay away from danger.
- **Channel Energy to Turn Undead (Standard Action):** Makes undead enemies flee. Save this for when you encounter zombies, skeletons, etc.

# Your Special Abilities

## Grave Touch (7/day)

Make a melee touch attack against a living creature. If you hit, they become **shaken** for 1 round (they take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks). If you touch a creature that's already shaken, it becomes **frightened** and must run away!

**_Tip:_** _This is dangerous to use since you're squishy. Best used when you're out of spells or an enemy gets too close._

## Turn Undead (7/day)

You can channel energy to make undead creatures flee. Undead within 30 feet must make a Will save (DC 10) or be turned for 1 minute. Turned undead flee from you as best they can.

**_Tip:_** _Save this ability specifically for undead encounters. It won't work on living creatures!_

## Arcane Bond (Object)

You have a bonded object (ask your GM what item you chose-common choices are a ring, amulet, or wand). Once per day, you can use this object to cast any spell in your spellbook, even if you didn't prepare it!

**Warning:** If you try to cast a spell without your bonded object, you must succeed on a concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell!

# Spellcasting Guide

## How Wizard Spells Work

Unlike spontaneous casters (like sorcerers), you must **prepare** your spells each morning. This means choosing which spells to "load" into your brain from your spellbook. Once cast, a spell is used up until you prepare again.

| **Spell Level** | **Slots/Day** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 (Cantrips) | 3 prepared | Cast unlimited times per day |
| 1st Level | 3 + 1 school | The +1 must be a Necromancy spell |

## Your Spell Save DC

When enemies try to resist your spells, they roll against your spell DC:

- **Base DC:** 10 + spell level + Intelligence modifier (+4) = 14 + spell level
- **Necromancy Spells:** Add +1 from Spell Focus (Necromancy) = 15 + spell level

## Opposition Schools

You've given up Conjuration and Divination magic. Spells from these schools cost **two** spell slots to prepare instead of one. Also, you **cannot** use your bonded object to cast spells from these schools.

## Recommended Starting Spells

Work with your GM to fill your spellbook. Here are some good choices for a beginning necromancer:

**Cantrips (0-level, unlimited use):**

- **Ray of Frost:** Ranged attack dealing 1d3 cold damage
- **Daze:** Stun a humanoid for 1 round
- **Disrupt Undead:** Deal 1d6 damage to undead (fits your theme!)

**1st-Level Spells:**

- **Cause Fear (Necromancy):** Make one creature flee-benefits from Spell Focus!
- **Ray of Enfeeblement (Necromancy):** Weaken an enemy's Strength
- **Chill Touch (Necromancy):** Touch attack dealing 1d6 damage
- **Color Spray:** Can knock out weak enemies
- **Mage Armor:** Boosts your AC to 15 for hours!

# Using Your Skills

Skills represent things your character has trained to do. When using a skill, roll a d20 and add your skill bonus. Here are your best skills:

| **Skill** | **Bonus** | **Use It For** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Knowledge (Arcana) | **+8** | Identify spells, magical beasts, constructs |
| Knowledge (Planes) | **+8** | Know about outsiders, planes of existence |
| Knowledge (Religion) | **+8** | Identify undead, know about gods and rituals |
| Spellcraft | **+8** | Identify spells being cast, learn new spells |
| Stealth | **+5** | Hide and move quietly (hobgoblin bonus!) |

## Pragmatic Activator Trait

Your Pragmatic Activator trait lets you use Intelligence (+4) instead of Charisma (+0) for Use Magic Device checks. This makes you surprisingly good at using wands, scrolls, and other magic items!

# Survival Tips for Level 1

Level 1 wizards are extremely fragile. Here's how to stay alive:

- **Stay Behind the Melee:** Let fighters and other tough characters engage enemies first. Your 8 HP won't last in a direct fight.
- **Cast Mage Armor First:** If you have it prepared, cast it before entering dangerous areas. It lasts hours and boosts your AC from 11 to 15.
- **Use Cantrips Liberally:** Your cantrips (0-level spells) can be cast unlimited times. Save your 1st-level slots for important moments.
- **Use Stealth:** With +5 Stealth (thanks to your hobgoblin heritage), you can sometimes avoid fights entirely.
- **Buy a Crossbow:** When you run out of spells, a light crossbow lets you contribute from a safe distance.
- **Scribe Scrolls:** Your Scribe Scroll feat lets you create spell scrolls during downtime, giving you more options in a pinch.

# Roleplaying Elkfor

## Your Hobgoblin Heritage

Hobgoblins are militaristic goblinoids known for their discipline and strategic minds. Unlike savage goblins, hobgoblins value order, planning, and martial prowess. Consider how this might shape Elkfor's personality-perhaps he approaches necromancy with scholarly precision rather than dark malice.

## Why Necromancy?

Think about why Elkfor chose to study the magic of death. Some possibilities: academic curiosity about the boundary between life and death, a desire to protect others by commanding undead soldiers, seeking to overcome the weakness of mortal flesh, or perhaps a personal loss that sparked interest in death's mysteries.

## Languages

You speak Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Giant, Goblin, and Infernal. This makes you an excellent translator and negotiator-useful when the party encounters creatures who don't speak Common!
