## Who Is Sebastian?

Sebastian is a **Duskwalker** (a mortal reborn from the River of Souls with a connection to the afterlife) and a level 1 **Investigator** with the **Cartographer** archetype. He's a brilliant scholar, mapmaker, and detective — not a frontline fighter.

**Alignment:** Chaotic Good — You're a good person who values freedom and follows your conscience over rules.

**Concept:** Think Sherlock Holmes meets a cartographer who can see ghosts. You solve mysteries, explore unknown places, and have a supernatural edge against the undead.

---

## Your Role in the Party

✅ **You ARE:**
- The skill expert (Knowledge, Perception, investigation)
- The trap-finder and dungeon explorer
- The ghost/undead specialist
- The alchemist who makes useful extracts

❌ **You are NOT:**
- A frontline fighter (8 HP, AC 10, +0 to hit)
- A healer (though you have Heal +6 for skill checks)
- A face/diplomat (Cha 8)

**Stay behind the fighters. Use your brain, not your sword.**

⚠️ **Note:** You don't have Disable Device as a trained skill on this sheet! Ask your GM if this is an oversight — Investigators should have it.

---

## Alchemy & Extracts

You're an alchemist who makes **extracts** — personal potions that only work for you.

### How Extracts Work
1. Each morning, spend 1 minute per extract to prepare them
2. Drink an extract as a standard action to gain its effect
3. Extracts only work for YOU (they go inert if someone else holds them)
4. You use the **Alchemist formula list**

### Your Formula Book
Your character sheet shows an empty formula book. At level 1, you should have:
- **2 free 1st-level formulae** of your choice
- **+2 more** (from Int 14)
- **= 4 total 1st-level formulae**

**Ask your GM to help you pick these!** Good choices for a new Investigator:

| Formula | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Cure Light Wounds** | Heal 1d8+1 HP (drink in emergencies!) |
| **Shield** | +4 shield bonus to AC for 1 min/level |
| **Expeditious Retreat** | +30 ft speed for 1 min/level |
| **Comprehend Languages** | Understand any language for 10 min/level |
| **Detect Secret Doors** | Reveals hidden doors within 60 ft |
| **Identify** | Identify magic items |

### Extracts Per Day
At level 1 with Int 14, you can prepare: **2 first-level extracts per day**

### Identifying Potions
You can use Craft (Alchemy) +6 to identify potions like *detect magic* — hold the potion for 1 round and roll!

## Duskwalker Abilities — Ghost Hunter

Your soul has crossed the River of Souls and returned. You have special power over the undead.

### Ghost Hunter (Supernatural)
Your weapons are partially effective against ghosts and incorporeal undead:

| Weapon Type | Damage vs Incorporeal |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Non-magical | **Half damage** (normally 0!) |
| Magical | Full damage + **can crit and sneak attack** |

**Once per day (standard action):** All your weapons gain **ghost touch** for 1 minute — full damage against incorporeal creatures!

### Ward Against Corruption
- **+2 bonus** on saves vs negative energy and death effects
- **+2 bonus** vs spell-like/supernatural abilities of undead and sahkils
- **Immune** to being turned into undead (no vampire spawn for you!)

### Skilled (Racial)
+2 racial bonus to Knowledge (Religion) and Heal. *(Note: Knowledge Religion isn't on your skill list — you may want to add it!)*

## Combat — Survival Mode

You're fragile. Here's how to stay alive:

### Before Combat
1. **Drink Shield extract** if you have it prepared (+4 AC for several minutes)
2. **Stay behind the frontliners**
3. **Use Perception** to spot enemies/traps before they spot you

### During Combat

**Option B: Fight (Only if Necessary)**
- Rapier: Roll d20+0 to hit, 1d6 damage, crit on 18-20
- Your crit range is your best combat feature — fish for crits!
- Consider spending 2 Inspiration on important attacks

**Option C: Run Away**
- You have 30 ft speed
- Withdraw action: move without provoking attacks of opportunity
- Use Expeditious Retreat extract for +30 ft speed

### If Fighting Undead/Ghosts
This is where you shine!
1. Activate **Ghost Hunter** (standard action, 1/day) for ghost touch
2. Your weapons can now fully damage incorporeal creatures
3. You can crit and use precision damage against them

## Roleplaying Tips

Sebastian is a scholar and explorer who has literally died and come back. Consider:

- **Connection to death:** You've seen the other side. How does that affect your worldview?
- **Cartographer's curiosity:** You want to map the unknown. Uncharted dungeons excite you.
- **Analytical mind:** You notice details others miss. Describe what you observe.
- **Duskwalker nature:** You have a psychopomp's duty to oppose undead and those who disrupt the cycle of souls.

**Party Role:** You're the one who says "Wait — let me check for traps first" and "Actually, I read about these creatures..." You make the party smarter and safer.

*Good luck exploring, Sebastian!*
