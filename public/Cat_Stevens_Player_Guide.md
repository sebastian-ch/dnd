# Cat Stevens — New Player's Guide

## Who Is Cat Stevens?

Cat Stevens is a **Catfolk Bard**, a charismatic feline performer who supports the party with magical music, charms enemies, and handles social situations. You're not a front-line fighter — you're the party's buffer, face, and utility caster.

## Your Turn in Combat: The Basics

### Step 1: Roll Initiative
When combat starts, roll a d20 and add **+2**. This determines when you act each round.

### Step 2: On Your Turn
You typically get **one move action** and **one standard action**.

**Most Common Turn — Start Inspire Courage:**
1. **Standard action:** Begin your Bardic Performance (Inspire Courage).
2. **Move action:** Position yourself safely (stay behind the fighters!).
3. **Following rounds:** Maintain performance as a **free action**, leaving you free to do other things.

Once Inspire Courage is running, your allies within earshot get **+1 to attack rolls, +1 to damage, and +1 to saves vs. fear/charm**. This is your primary job!

**Other Combat Options:**
- **Cast a spell** (standard action)
- **Use your Wand of Ray of Frost:** Ranged touch attack, deals 1d3 cold damage. Better than your whip!
- **Fascinate an enemy** (see below)

## Your Key Numbers at a Glance

| Stat | Value | When to Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Wand (Ray of Frost)** | Ranged touch attack (roll vs touch AC) | 1d3 cold damage |
| **Whip Attack** | -1 | Avoid using this if possible |
| **AC** | 15 | What enemies need to hit you |
| **HP** | 8 | You're fragile — stay safe! |
| **Initiative** | +2 | Added to your roll at combat start |
| **Concentration** | +6 | For casting spells while threatened |
| **Bluff** | +9 | Lying, feinting, creating distractions |
| **Diplomacy** | +9 | Persuading, negotiating, making friends |
| **Stealth** | +8 | Sneaking around |
| **Perception** | +4 | Spotting things |

## Bardic Performance (9 rounds/day)

This is your most important ability. You have **9 rounds of performance per day** — use them wisely!

### Starting & Maintaining
- **Start:** Standard action
- **Maintain:** Free action each round
- **Switch performances:** Standard action (must stop old one, start new one)

### Inspire Courage (Your Bread & Butter)
While performing, all allies who can hear you get:
- **+1 to attack rolls**
- **+1 to weapon damage**
- **+1 to saves vs. charm and fear**

This stacks with other bonuses and affects the whole party. Start this at the beginning of most fights!

### Fascinate
- Target: 1 creature within 90 ft. that can see and hear you
- **Will save DC 15** or they sit and watch you, fascinated
- They take **-4 to Perception** and reactive skill checks
- Breaks if they're threatened or attacked
- Great for taking one enemy out of a fight temporarily, or for non-combat situations

### Countersong & Distraction
Defensive performances that let allies use your Perform check instead of their saving throw against sonic/language-dependent effects (Countersong) or illusion patterns/figments (Distraction). Situational but powerful when relevant.

## Survival Tips for New Players

1. **Stay in the back.** You have only 8 HP and weak combat stats. Let the fighters handle melee.

2. **Start Inspire Courage early.** Turn 1 of most combats, start performing. Your whole party benefits.

3. **Track your performance rounds.** You only have 9/day. Mark them off as you use them.

4. **Use your wand.** Ray of Frost is a ranged touch attack (easier to hit) and does more reliable damage than your whip.

5. **Save Cat's Luck.** Use it when a failed Reflex save would really hurt — like a fireball or a pit trap.

6. **You're the face.** With +9 Bluff and Diplomacy, you should handle most social interactions.

7. **Fascinate can end encounters.** Against a single intelligent enemy, Fascinate can take them out of the fight entirely while your party deals with others.

8. **Run away if needed.** Sprinter gives you 40 ft. movement when withdrawing — use it!

## What to Do Outside Combat

- **Diplomacy (+9):** Negotiate, persuade, make friends with NPCs.
- **Bluff (+9):** Lie, deceive, create distractions.
- **Stealth (+8):** Sneak when needed.
- **Knowledge (any, +1):** You can attempt any Knowledge check. Ask the GM "What do I know about this?"
- **Identify:** Use the spell to identify magic items the party finds.
- **Entertain:** You have a masterwork lute. Perform for crowds, earn money, gather information.
