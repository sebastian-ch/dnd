# Stixon — New Player's Guide

## Who Is Stixon?

Stixon is a **Wyrwood Ranger**, a small wooden construct (think a living puppet or automaton) who hunts with a bow and has a trained bird companion. He's built as a ranged attacker who specializes in fighting undead.

## Your Turn in Combat: The Basics

### Step 1: Roll Initiative
When combat starts, roll a d20 and add **+3**. This determines when you act each round.

### Step 2: On Your Turn
You typically get **one move action** and **one standard action** (or one full-round action).

**Most Common Turn — Shoot Your Bow:**
1. **Move** into a good position (ideally 30+ feet from enemies so melee threats can't reach you easily).
2. **Attack** with your longbow:
   - Roll **d20 + 3** to hit.
   - If you hit, roll **1d6 damage** (or **1d6 + 3** against undead!).
   - Critical threat on a natural 20 → roll to confirm, then deal **×3 damage**.

**If You Don't Need to Move:**
You can take a **Full Attack** (though at level 1, you only have one attack anyway, so this matters more later).

| **vs. Undead** | +2 atk, +3 dmg | Your specialty! |

| **Initiative** | +3 | Added to your roll at combat start |

## Your Special Abilities

### Favored Enemy: Undead
Against zombies, skeletons, vampires, etc., you get:
- **+2 to hit** (attack roll becomes +5)
- **+2 to damage** (plus +1 from Undead Crusader trait = +3 total)
- **+2 to Bluff, Perception, Sense Motive, Survival** checks involving them

This is your bread and butter — you're built to destroy undead.

### Construct Traits (Wyrwood Racial Abilities)
You're a living construct, which means:
- **Immune to:** Mind-affecting effects, poison, disease, sleep, paralysis, bleed, death effects, fatigue, exhaustion, ability damage/drain, energy drain, and nonlethal damage.
- **No Constitution score:** You can't be healed by normal healing spells like *cure light wounds*. You need *make whole* or the Craft Construct feat to be repaired.
- **Don't breathe, eat, or sleep:** Useful for keeping watch!

**Important Limitation:** If you drop to 0 HP, you're immediately destroyed (no dying/stabilizing). Stay safe!

### Darkvision 60 ft. & Low-Light Vision
You can see in complete darkness up to 60 feet (in black and white) and can see twice as far as humans in dim light.

### Track
Add +1 to Survival checks when following tracks (already included in your "Survival (tracking)" skill of +6).

## Your Bird Companion

You have a **falcon (or similar bird of prey)** as an animal companion. At level 1, it's fairly fragile (half normal HP), but it can:

- **Scout** ahead with its excellent Perception.
- **Distract enemies:** Use the Distract trick — the bird attacks an enemy; on a hit, that enemy is **shaken for 1 round** (–2 to attacks, saves, and checks). Costs a Handle Animal check (DC 20) to command.
- **Roam:** You can send it to forage for up to a week and it'll return.

**Commanding Your Bird:** Typically a **move action** and a **Handle Animal check** (you have +4). Pushing it to do a trick it doesn't know is DC 25.

## Survival Tips for New Players

1. **Stay at range.** Your longbow is your main weapon, and you have no armor. Keep enemies at a distance.

2. **Use cover.** Standing behind a low wall or ally gives you +4 AC against ranged attacks.

3. **Focus undead.** Your bonuses make you highly effective against them. Prioritize them when they appear.

4. **Use your bird tactically.** The Distract trick can debuff a dangerous enemy, making it easier for your party to hit them.

5. **Remember your immunities.** If the GM describes poison gas, a sleep spell, or a fear effect — ask if it's mind-affecting or requires a Fort save. You might be immune!

6. **Track ammunition.** You have 60 arrows. Mark them off as you use them.

7. **Healing is tricky.** Remind your party you need *make whole* (a 2nd-level spell) rather than *cure wounds* to heal. Potions won't work on you.

## What to Do Outside Combat

- **Stealth (+9):** You're excellent at sneaking. Offer to scout ahead (especially with darkvision).
- **Perception (+5):** Help the party spot traps and ambushes.
- **Survival (+5/+6):** Track enemies, find food/water, avoid getting lost.
- **Handle Animal (+4):** Command your bird or interact with other animals.
- **Knowledge (Religion):** You have a +1 trait bonus and it's a class skill — useful for identifying undead.
