## Who Is Fluff?

Fluff is a **Gnome Paladin** — a tiny holy warrior devoted to righteousness and smiting evil. Despite being small in stature, you're a durable frontline fighter with excellent AC and the divine power to strike down evil.

**Alignment:** Lawful Good — You uphold honor, keep your word, and protect the innocent. Your paladin code demands it.

**Concept:** A pint-sized knight in shining armor who hits surprisingly hard and refuses to stay down.

---

## Your Role in the Party

✅ **You ARE:**
- A frontline tank (AC 17, solid HP)
- An evil-detector and smiter
- Surprisingly hard to kill (Fey Foundling makes healing very effective on you)
- Bonus damage against goblins and reptilians

❌ **You are NOT:**
- Fast (15 ft speed is painful)
- A skill monkey (most skills at -4 to -6)
- A healer yet (Lay on Hands comes at level 2)

---

## Combat — Your Standard Approach

### Before Combat
1. **Detect Evil** (at will) — Scan for evil creatures so you know who to Smite
2. **Position carefully** — Your 15 ft speed means you need to plan your approach

### Your Combat Turn

**Opening Round vs Evil Enemy:**
1. **Move** up to 15 ft toward the enemy
2. **Smite Evil** (swift action) — Declare your target
3. **Attack** with longsword: Roll d20+4, deal 1d8+3 damage (+1 from Smite)

**Standard Attack Round:**
- Longsword: Roll **d20+4** to hit
- Damage: **1d8+2** (or 1d8+3 with Smite active)
- Crit on **19-20** (roll to confirm)

**Vs Goblins or Reptilians:**
- Your **Hatred** ability gives **+1 to attack rolls**
- Total attack bonus: **+5** against these enemies!

### Smite Evil — Your Big Ability

**1/day, Swift Action**

| Bonus | Value | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Attack bonus | +0 | (Based on Cha, which is 10) |
| Damage bonus | +1 | (+2 on first hit vs evil outsiders, dragons, or undead) |
| AC bonus | +0 | (Based on Cha) |
| Bypass DR | YES | All your attacks ignore damage reduction! |

**When to Smite:**
- ✅ Against confirmed evil enemies (use Detect Evil first!)
- ✅ Against enemies with damage reduction
- ✅ Against evil outsiders, dragons, or undead (extra damage)
- ❌ Don't waste it on mooks — save it for the boss

**Note:** Your low Charisma means Smite Evil is mainly useful for bypassing DR and the small damage boost. It'll get better as you level up and potentially improve your Charisma.

## Detect Evil — Your Radar

**At will, no limit**

| Action | What You Learn |
|--------|----------------|
| Standard (1st round) | Presence or absence of evil auras in 60 ft cone |
| Standard (2nd round) | Number of evil auras and strongest aura's strength |
| Standard (3rd round) | Location and strength of each aura |
| **Move action** | Focus on ONE target within 60 ft — learn its aura strength immediately |

**Pro Tip:** Use the move action version! Point at a suspicious NPC and instantly know if they're evil.

**Aura Strength by HD:**

| Creature HD | Aura Strength |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1 or lower | Faint |
| 2-4 | Moderate |
| 5-10 | Strong |
| 11+ | Overwhelming |

---

## Fey Foundling — Your Secret Weapon

Your feat **Fey Foundling** does two things:

### ✅ BENEFIT: Supercharged Healing
Whenever you receive **magical healing**, you gain **+2 HP per die rolled**.

| Healing Source | Normal | With Fey Foundling |
|----------------|--------|-------------------|
| Cure Light Wounds (1d8+1) | 5-9 HP | **7-11 HP** |
| Channel Energy (1d6) | 1-6 HP | **3-8 HP** |
| Lay on Hands (1d6 at lvl 2) | 1-6 HP | **3-8 HP** |

This makes you incredibly efficient to heal — tell your party's healer!

### ⚠️ DRAWBACK: Cold Iron Vulnerability
You take **+1 damage per die** from cold iron weapons.

**Irony Alert:** Your own sword is cold iron! If an enemy disarms you and hits you with it, it hurts extra. Don't let that happen.

---

## Gnome Racial Abilities

### Combat Bonuses
| Ability | Bonus |
|---------|-------|
| **Hatred** | +1 attack vs goblinoids and reptilians |
| **Defensive Training** | +4 dodge AC vs giants |

### Senses
- **Low-Light Vision:** See twice as far as humans in dim light
- **Keen Senses:** +2 Perception (already included in your +3)

### Saving Throw Bonuses
- **Illusion Resistance:** +2 vs illusion spells and effects
- **Indomitable Faith (trait):** +1 Will saves (already included)

### Gnome Magic
**Note:** You need Charisma 11+ to use gnome spell-like abilities. With Cha 10, you **cannot** use dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation, or speak with animals. If you ever increase your Charisma, these unlock!

---

## Defensive Summary

| Defense | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **AC** | 17 | Banded mail (+7) |
| **Touch AC** | 10 | |
| **Flat-Footed** | 17 | |
| **AC vs Giants** | 21 | Defensive Training (+4 dodge) |
| **Fort Save** | +3 | |
| **Ref Save** | +0 | Weak point! |
| **Will Save** | +4 | Solid |
| **Will vs Illusions** | +6 | Illusion Resistance |
| **Saves vs Death** | +5 Fort | +2 bonus vs death effects |

### ⚠️ Watch Out For
- **Reflex saves (+0):** Fireballs and traps hurt. Stay away from obvious trap triggers.
- **Speed (15 ft):** Enemies can kite you. Charge when possible, or ready actions.
- **Ranged attacks:** You have no ranged option. Consider buying a sling or crossbow.

---

## Your Equipment

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Banded Mail** | +7 AC, -6 armor check penalty, 35 lbs |
| **MW Cold Iron Longsword** | +1 attack (masterwork), bypasses DR/cold iron, good vs fey |

### Why Cold Iron?
Cold iron weapons bypass the damage reduction of demons, fey, and some other creatures. As a paladin, you'll fight demons — this sword is thematically perfect.

Just remember: it also hurts YOU more if used against you (Fey Foundling drawback).

---

## Skills

Your heavy armor gives -6 to many physical skills. Focus on what you're good at:

| Skill | Bonus | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Sense Motive** | +5 | Detect lies and read people |
| **Heal** | +5 | First aid, stabilize dying allies |
| **Perception** | +3 | Spot things (+2 racial) |

Everything else is penalized by armor. Let others handle Stealth, Acrobatics, etc.

---

## Movement — Your Biggest Challenge

**15 feet per round** is brutally slow. Here's how to cope:

### Charging
- Move up to **double speed (30 ft)** in a straight line
- **+2 to attack**, but **-2 to AC** until your next turn
- Must have a clear path

### Readied Actions
If enemies are approaching:
- "I ready an action to attack the first enemy that comes within reach"
- Let them come to you!

### Positioning
- Start combat as close to enemies as possible
- Ask allies to funnel enemies toward you
- Use terrain (doorways, corridors) to force enemies to engage you

### Future Solutions
- **Mount:** A riding dog or pony lets you move much faster
- **Mithral Armor:** Eventually, mithral banded mail would reduce penalties
- **Expeditious Retreat:** If a party member can cast this on you

## Shopping List (Priority Purchases)

1. **Light Crossbow + 20 bolts** (37 gp) → Ranged option for when you can't close distance
2. **Sling + 10 bullets** (1 sp) → Free ranged attacks (bullets are free), uses Str for damage
3. **Holy Symbol, wooden** (1 gp) → Needed for paladin spells at level 4
4. **Potion of Cure Light Wounds** (50 gp) → Emergency healing (extra effective with Fey Foundling!)
5. **Traveler's Any-Tool** (250 gp, when affordable) → Helps with skill checks you're bad at

## Leveling Up — What's Coming

| Level | Key Abilities |
|-------|---------------|
| 2 | **Lay on Hands** (1d6 healing, uses/day = 1 + Cha mod), **Divine Grace** (+Cha to all saves) |
| 3 | **Aura of Courage** (immune to fear, allies +4 vs fear), **Divine Health** (immune to disease), **Mercy** (remove conditions with Lay on Hands) |
| 4 | **Spells!** (1st-level paladin spells), **Channel Positive Energy**, **Smite Evil 2/day** |
| 5 | **Divine Bond** (bonded weapon or mount!) |

**Level 2 is huge** — Divine Grace will add your Charisma to all saves. Consider boosting Charisma at level 4 to improve this, Smite Evil, and unlock your gnome spell-like abilities.

---

## Languages

You speak: **Common, Gnome, Sylvan**

- **Sylvan:** Language of fey creatures — interesting given your Fey Foundling background!

## Roleplaying Tips

Fluff is a gnome with a fey heritage (Fey Foundling) who has devoted himself to a holy cause. Consider:

- **Fey origins:** Were you raised by fey? Found in a fairy ring? This shapes your worldview.
- **Small but mighty:** You're tiny but wear heavy armor and fight on the front lines. That takes courage.
- **Paladin's code:** You must act with honor, help those in need, and punish evil. How strictly do you interpret this?
- **Gnome curiosity:** Gnomes are often curious and playful — how does that mesh with your serious paladin duties?

**Party Role:** You're the moral compass and the one who walks toward danger so others don't have to. You detect evil, call out villainy, and stand firm.
